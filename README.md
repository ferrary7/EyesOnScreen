This repository is here to master yourselves in Touch-TypingðŸ¤©!
<br>
Touch typing (also called blind typing, or touch keyboarding) is a style of typing.
<br> Although the phrase refers to typing without using the sense of sight to find the keysâ€”specifically, a touch typist will know their location on the keyboard through muscle memoryâ€”the term is often used to refer to a specific form of touch typing that involves placing the eight fingers in a horizontal row along the middle of the keyboard (the home row) and having them reach for specific other keys.
